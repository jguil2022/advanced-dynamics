Applied Mechanics II (or Dynamics) is the study of how things move and interact.
We are limiting our study to Newtonian mechanics. We won't consider quantum
effects like wave-particle duality or relativistic effects. Our current interest
is to describe free and constrained motion much less than the speed of light and
with mass much larger than an atom, but much smaller than the sun (~1e-27 < m <
2e30 kg). 

The two founding scientists of classical dynamics are [Galileo
Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei) (1564-1642) and [Isaac
Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) (1642-1726). Galileo
described the geometry of moving objects and helped define our understanding of
kinematics. Newton defined three kinetic laws that helped describe how force,
impact, and energy relate to changes in motion. 

This introduction will get you up to speed on the tools we are using to explore
dynamics: HuskyCT, Google Documents, Adams multibody dynamics, and Piazza
discussion board.
